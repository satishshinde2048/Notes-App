## `Project Description`

Flashcard Generator App is a frontend application for creating and managing flashcards. It allows users to 
  create multiple flashcards within a group. The application consists of three main pages:

  1. Create New Page:
     This page enables users to create a new flashcard. It contains two forms: one for entering the name and 
     description of the flashcard, and another for adding 
     individual card names and descriptions. The dynamic form is implemented using Formik. After clicking the 
     Create button, the flashcard will be created.

  1. My FlashCard Page:
   On this page, users can view all the created card groups. Each group is displayed with a heading, description, 
   total number of cards in the group, and a button 
   for viewing the cards on the next page.

  1. FlashCard Details Page:
   This page allows users to view the created flashcards. Users can navigate between different flashcards by 
   clicking on the sidebar terms associated with each 
   card group. Additionally, they can share, print, and download the flashcards.


### `Features`

 + Implemented agile methodology for designing, analyzing, and developing the frontend project. The entire 
    project  was planned out as a single sprint of 2 weeks.


  + This application helps to create new flashcards and access created flashcards.

 
  + Utilized React, React-Redux, and localStorage to manage data, React-router for routing, and Tailwind CSS for 
   component development and responsive design.

 
  + Improved the project’s efficiency by implementing validation using Formik.js on all the existing input fields, 
   and extensive testing was carried out
